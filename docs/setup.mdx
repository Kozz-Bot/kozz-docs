# Setup

The setup is yet very complicated and convoluted. I will work on some buildscript for a simple hello-world example in a near future. For now, you have to set all up manually.

- Create a folder with the name of your project and `cd` into it

```bash
mkdir my-bot
cd my-bot
```

- Run the following script. It will clone all the repositories, install the dependencies and build them

```bash
# this one has to be the first
git clone git@github.com:Kozz-Bot/kozz-types.git
cd kozz-types
yarn && yarn tsc
cd ..

git clone git@github.com:Kozz-Bot/Kozz-Gateway.git
cd Kozz-Gateway
yarn && yarn tsc
cd ..


git clone git@github.com:Kozz-Bot/kozz-module-maker.git
cd kozz-module-maker
yarn && yarn tsc
cd ..

git clone git@github.com:Kozz-Bot/kozz-wa.git
cd kozz-wa
yarn && yarn tsc
cd ..
```

- Run this script to generate a keypair to authenticate with the gateway

```bash
cd kozz-module-maker
./scripts/generate_key_pair.sh
```

You shall see a folder `./keys` with a public and a private key in the `kozz-module-maker` root folder

```
└── kozz-module-maker/
    └── keys/
        ├── publickey.pem
        └── privatekey.pem
```

_Note:_ This assumes you are running the script on linux. If you are using windows, you can manually generate a key pair using putty-keygen and drop them in the correct folders

- Now copy the public key to the Gateway's keys folder

```
└── kozz-gw/
    └── keys/
        └── publickey.pem (this file)
```

- And the private key into the `kozz-wa/keys` folder

```
└── kozz-gw/
    └── keys/
        └── privatekey.pem (this file)
```

- Start the Gateway and go back to the root

```bash
cd kozz-gw
yarn start
```

- Start whatsapp service, authenticate and go back to the root

```bash
cd kozz-wa
yarn start
```

_Note_: Do the authentication scanning the QR code in the terminal. For more anwsers, visit https://wwebjs.dev/guide/#first-steps

- Create the folder you want to instantiate the modules for controlling your chat and copy the privatekey into the corresponding folder

```bash
# Make sure you are in the folder you cloned all the repositories
mkdir my-bot-modules
ls
# The output should look like this
# Kozz-Gateway/  kozz-module-maker/  kozz-types/  kozz-wa/  my-bot-modules/
cd my-bot-modules
```

- Init your node project and install the module maker dependency

```bash
yarn init
yarn add ../kozz-module-maker
```

Finally, you are all set!
