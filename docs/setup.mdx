# Setup

- Create a folder with the name of your project and `cd` into it

```bash
mkdir my-bot
cd my-bot
```

- Run the following script. It will clone all the repositories, install the dependencies and build them

```bash

git clone git@github.com:Kozz-Bot/Kozz-Gateway.git
cd Kozz-Gateway
yarn && yarn tsc
cd ..
```

- Run this script to generate a keypair to authenticate with the gateway

```bash
# if you are using linux/mac-os
cd kozz-gw && ./scripts/generate_key_pair.sh
```

```bash
# if you are using windows
cd kozz-gw 
./scripts/generate_key_pair.ps1
```

You shall see a folder `./keys` with a public and a private key in the `kozz-gw` root folder

```
└── kozz-gw/
    └── keys/
        ├── publickey.pem
        └── privatekey.pem
```

- Add the Whatsapp boudary to your bot's folder

```bash
# if you are using linux/mac-os
./scripts/add_boundary.sh wa
```
```bash
# if you are using windows
./scripts/add_boundary.ps1 wa
```

- Now leave the public key in the Gateway's keys folder

```
└── kozz-gw/
    └── keys/
        └── publickey.pem (this file)
```

- And copy the private key into the `kozz-wa/keys` folder

```
└── kozz-gw/
    └── keys/
        └── privatekey.pem (this file)
```

- Start the Gateway in one terminal

```bash
cd kozz-gw
yarn start
```

- Start whatsapp in another terminal and authenticate with whatsapp scanning the QR-code

```bash
cd kozz-wa
yarn start
```

_Note¹_: Do the authentication scanning the QR code in the terminal. For more anwsers, visit https://wwebjs.dev/guide/#first-steps
_Note²_: The name of the Whatsapp client will be `'Kozz-Whatsapp'`. Its important to keep track of the name of the services for reasons you will see in the future. Check the .env.example to see how to change values.

- Create the folder you want to instantiate the modules for controlling your chat and copy the privatekey into the corresponding folder

```bash
# Make sure you are in the folder you cloned all the repositories
mkdir my-bot-modules
ls
# The output should look like this
# Kozz-Gateway/ kozz-wa/  my-bot-modules/
cd my-bot-modules
```

- Init your node project and install the module maker dependency

```bash
yarn init
yarn add kozz-module-maker
yarn add -D kozz-types
```

Finally, you are all set!
