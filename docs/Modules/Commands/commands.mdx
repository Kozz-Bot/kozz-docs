# Commands

First, we need to tell the gateway that this module wants to do something. The gateway will them send payloads to this module expecting it to handle those payloads and react accordingly.

One way of telling the gateway to send payloads to the module is by creating commands.

The Kozz-Bot gateway has an in-built CLI-ish like parser which we will make use of.

Since the name of our module is `ping`, whenever someone sends a message starting with `/ping`, the gateway will know the author of the message is trying to talk to our module.

The second word of the command correspond to a method defined in our module. Lets define a method for our module so that it can awnser our command.

Your code should look like this:

```typescript
import { createModule, createMethod } from "kozz-module-maker";

const myModule = createModule({
  name: "ping",
  address: "http://127.0.0.1:4521",
  // Add this
  commands: {
    boundariesToHandle: ["*"],
    methods: {
      ...createMethod("test", (requester) => requester.reply("pong!")),
    },
  },
});
```

Try restarting your module and sending `!ping test`. The bot should reply `pong!`!

Lets break down even further what is going on:

- With the object `commands` you define that this module will awnser to commands.
- The properties `BoundariesToHandle` defines from which boundaries you want to process commands. `*` is the way to awnser from all the boundaries
- Evoking `createMethod` you define a method called `test` that only replies `pong!`. The interface for communication with the boundary is mainly defined by the `requester` object

However, you don't want to have to use two words for a command. You want to use `!ping`. How can we accomplish that?

If you omit the method name from the command string, the module will try to call a special method: `default`.

```typescript
import { createModule, createMethod } from "kozz-module-maker";

const myModule = createModule({
  name: "ping",
  address: "http://127.0.0.1:4521",
  commands: {
    boundariesToHandle: ["*"],
    methods: {
      // special method name
      ...createMethod("default", (requester) => requester.reply("pong!")),
    },
  },
});
```

Now the bot will reply `pong!` if you type `!ping`, without needing to input in the command the name of the method!
