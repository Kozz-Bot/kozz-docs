### Command methods and their fallbacks

If you omit the method name from the command string, the module will try to call a special method: `default`.

```typescript
import { createModule, createMethod } from "kozz-module-maker";

const myModule = createModule({
  name: "ping",
  address: `127.0.0.1::4521`,
  commands: {
    boundariesToHandle: ["*"],
    methods: {
      // special method name
      ...createMethod("default", (requester) => requester.reply("pong!")),
    },
  },
});
```

Now the bot will reply `pong!` if you type `!ping`, without needing to input in the command the name of the method!

You can also define a fallback method, for when the user types a comand for a method that is not defined:

```typescript
import { createModule, createMethod } from "kozz-module-maker";

const myModule = createModule({
  name: "ping",
  address: `127.0.0.1::4521`,
  commands: {
    boundariesToHandle: ["*"],
    methods: {
      // fallback method
      ...createMethod("fallback", (requester) =>
        requester.reply("Ooops, this method doesn't exist")
      ),
      ...createMethod("default", (requester) => requester.reply("pong!")),
    },
  },
});
```

| Command       | Bot's Response                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| !ping         | pong!                            |
| !ping default | pong!                            |
| !ping blah    | Ooops, this method doesn't exist |

In case the command is only `!ping` the bot will try to run the methods in the following order

- If there is a `default` method, run it
- If not, try to run a `fallback` method
- If none of the above exist, do nothing
