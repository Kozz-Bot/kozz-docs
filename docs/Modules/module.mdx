# Creating your modules

Let's start with a simple module:

```typescript
import { createModule } from "kozz-module-maker";

const myModule = createModule({
  name: "ping",
  // The defaut address of the gateway
  address: `127.0.0.1:4521`,
});
```

It should connect with the gateway with no problem. However it does nothing. How do we define behaviour to the module?
